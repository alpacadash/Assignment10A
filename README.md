"# Assignment10A" 
Write an assembly language subroutine that multiplies a doubleword array by an integer. 
Use the supplied C++ test program that creates an array, passes it to the subroutine, 
and prints the resulting timing values in comparison to a subroutine written in C++. Use 
the C++ subroutine as a model for how to write the Assembly Language subroutine.
